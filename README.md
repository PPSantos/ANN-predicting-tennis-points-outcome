Keras - Artificial Neural Network to predict tennis points outcome. <br>
This is part of the code that I used in my solution to the CrowdAnalytix competition. It uses a three-layer neural network to predict the outcome of a tennis points among three classes (Winner, Forced error, Unforced error). The model achieved an accuracy around 90%.
